## Program description

A comprehensive data study using the pandas library: From uploading data and correcting errors in the CSV files to
simple data visualization.

Data is everywhere: texts, images, news, and spreadsheets. It affects our habits and defines our future. The amount of
data is growing by the second. How can one stay afloat in this great sea of data? Data analysis is required in any line
of business. In this project, we conduct a comprehensive study with pandas. We download datasets, deal with
data omissions and incorrect data filling, find the main statistical characteristics, and visualize data.

Have fun!
